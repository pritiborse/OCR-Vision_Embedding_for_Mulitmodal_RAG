Do not   use sea/beach sand as it may contains   salts which could result in corrosion of   steel.  Use well graded sand and it should be   free from mud or any kind of dirt, silt or   organic matter.  Use mortar in the ratio of 1:3:0.5   (cement: sand: water) for 115 mm thick   masonry walls and 1:6:0.5 (cement:   sand: water) for 230 mm thick masonry   walls.  Adequate quantity of water should be   added such that sufficient workability in   mortar i s achieved during i ts   application.  Use minimum M20 (1:1.5:3) grade of   concrete in foundation, plinth beam,   bond beams, tie columns and slab.  Use super-plasticizer in concrete mix to   achieve adequate workability.  Use Fe 415 or higher grade of steel as   reinforcement.  Do not use corroded, old or bent bars.  Store reinforcement bars on a platform   to prevent corrosion.  Apply cement slurry over rebar to   protect from corrosion.  Use potable water for mixing and   curing, which should be free from   organic matter, oils, acids, salts or any   other substance that could result in   deterioration of concrete or steel.

    "text": "ON- SITE MATERIAL QUALITY TESTS  Take 6 random samples of bricks and calculate its average dry weight. Immerse bricks in water for 24 hrs, then again calculate their average   weight. The difference in final average weight and initial average weight indicates the amount of water absorbed by the bricks. It should not   exceed 20% of average weight of dry bricks.  Closely observe bricks for uniformity of their shapes, size and colour. Bricks should be rectangular in shape with sharp edges.  Put a scratch on the brick surface with finger nail. For brick to be hard enough, no impression or mark should be visible on the surface.  Open the bags to check the presence of lumps. Presence of lumps is the indication that setting has started, and thus that cement shall not be   suitable.  Take a pinch of cement and rub it between fingers. It should give a smooth texture, otherwise if it is rough, it indicates that the cement is   adulterated with sand. th  volume of glass in water and shake vigorously. After a minute, a distinct layer of settled silt and sand will be noticed. Measure its depth and calculate percent of silt content, which should be limited to 5%.  Rub a pinch of sand between the fingers. If fingers get stained, it indicates that the sand is adulterated with the earthy matter.  Add solution of caustic soda in sand to detect the presence of organic impurities. If the colour of solution changes into brown, it indicates the   presence of organic impurities. REINFORCEMENT  The bend test should be carried out with bending devices as specified in IS 1599: 1985. Absence of cracks in rebar shall be considered as the   evidence that the test piece withstood the bend test.  The tensile strength test and elongation of steel should be carried out with reference to IS 1608: 2005.
